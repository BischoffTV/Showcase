 ## Showcase Plugin
The Showcase plugin, developed under the package org.bischoff.showcase, is a feature-rich addition to your Minecraft server that integrates with the PlotSquared API. It provides enhanced control over plot-related events, specifically focusing on block placement and inventory interactions.

 ## Key Features
Block Placement Monitoring: The plugin monitors the placement of trapped chests, hoppers, normal chests, droppers, and dispensers. If a player places any of these blocks on a plot they own, and the block is named “Showcase”, the state of the block is updated.

Block Break Restriction: The plugin restricts players from breaking trapped chests, hoppers, normal chests, droppers, and dispensers placed on plots they do not own. This helps maintain the integrity of each player’s plot and prevents unauthorized modifications.

Inventory Interaction Control: The plugin controls inventory interactions with trapped chests, hoppers, normal chests, droppers, and dispensers named “Showcase”. If a player who does not own the plot tries to interact with the inventory of these blocks, the action is cancelled.

The Showcase plugin is a powerful tool for servers using the PlotSquared system, providing players with a secure and personalized building experience.
